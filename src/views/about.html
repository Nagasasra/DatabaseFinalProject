                <p>Our library was established in 1953 by 'Suparman', a fanatic of Superhero books, and he really idolizes 'Superman'. He liked it so much that he bought all of the superhero books, and soon his bookshelves could no longer hold all of them, so he decided to buy more bookshelves. And more bookshelves. And more. Eventually, there are so many bookshelves that it practically became a library, and thus our library was born. Our first and only library which is called 'Central Park Library' can be found in Jalan Sapiderman No. 69, Jakarta Timur, Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
